<a name="problem"><h2>Problem</h2></a>

<p>Instant messaging (<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_messaging">IM</a>) is a staple of the web and has been around
almost since its inception, starting with simple text-based programs
like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk_(Unix)">talk</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC">IRC</a> and progressing to
today's GUI-based IM clients from Yahoo, Microsoft, AOL, etc.
In this project you will design and implement an IM system, including 
both the client and the server.

The following characteristics constrain the design space of an IM
system:

<ul>

<li><b>Real-time communication.</b> An IM conversation happens in real
time: one person types some text, presses "enter," and the other
person (almost) immediately sees the text.

<li><b>Number of parties.</b> An IM conversation can happen between
two or more people. Some systems only allow two people to communicate;
others allow more than two people.  Most systems allow a person to be
involved in multiple conversations at the same time.

<li><b>Based on typed text.</b> The main mode of communication is via
text, as opposed to voice or video.

<li><b>Connected over a network.</b> The parties involved in the
communication may be in physically remote locations, and are connected
over the internet.

</ul>

<p>Your task will be to design an instant messaging system 
with the above properties, as well as additional properties
that you will incorporate into your design. This system will include a server
component that handles the transfer of messages and other data, and a client
component with a graphical user interface.</p>

<a name="purpose"><h2>Purpose</h2></a>

<p>The purpose of this project is twofold. First, you will learn
several Java technologies, including networking (to support
connectivity over a network), sockets and I/O (to support real-time,
text-based communication), and threads (to support two or more people
communicating concurrently). State machines may be useful to specify
certain aspects of the system's behavior.</p>

<p>Second, this project will introduce you to graphical user
interfaces. You will:</p>

<ul>
<li>become familiar with Swing, a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit for
Java, that is similar to many other such toolkits;</li>
<li>learn important GUI programming concepts, including the notion of a
<i>view hierarchy</i> and the <i>model-view-controller</i> design pattern;</li>
<li>use event-based programming and the publish-subscribe pattern
(i.e. Observer or Listener design pattern);</li>
<li>use object modeling notation to explore and express these structures;</li>
<li>and confront user interface design challenges.</li>
</ul>

<p>Throughout the project, you will need to design and implement mutable
datatypes, paying particular attention to their specifications and how they
interact with one another.</p>

<a name="specification"><h2>Specification</h2></a>

<img src="img/clientserver.png" style="float:right; margin-left:2em; margin-bottom:1em"/>

<p>Implement an IM system in Java with the following properties:</p>

<ul>

<li> <p><b>Client.</b> The client is a program that opens a
network connection with the IM server at a specified IP address
and port number. Once the connection is open, the client program
presents a graphical user interface for performing the interactions
listed below.
</p>

<li> <p> <b>Server.</b> The server is a program that accepts connections
from clients. A server should be able to maintain an unlimited number
of open client connections, and clients should be able to connect and
disconnect as they please.</p>

<p>The server is responsible for managing the state of both clients
and <i>conversations.</i></p>
  
<li> <p> <b>Conversations.</b> A conversation is an interactive
text-exchange session between some number of clients, and is the
ultimate purpose of the IM system. The exact nature of a conversation
is not specified (although the <a href="#hints">hints section</a> details a
couple possibilities), except to say that it allows clients to send
text messages to each other. Messaging in a conversation should be 
instantaneous, in the sense that incoming messages should be displayed immediately, 
not held until the recipient requests them.</p>

<li> <p> <b>Client/server interaction.</b> A client and server interact by
exchanging messages in a protocol of your devising &mdash; the protocol
is not specified. Using this protocol, the user interface presented by the
client should:</p>

<ul>
<li>Provide a facility for seeing which users are currently logged in;</li>
<li>Provide a facility for creating, joining and leaving conversations;</li>
<li>Allow the user to participate in multiple conversations simultaneously;</li>
<li>Visually separate messages of different conversations (e.g., into distinct windows, tabs, panes, etc.);</li>
<li>Provide a history of all the messages within a conversation for as long as the client is in that conversation;</li>
<!--<li>Distinguish between input and output, so that incoming messages do not appear interleaved with messages
still being composed.</li>-->
</ul>

<li> <p> <b>No authentication.</b> In a production system, logging in as a
client would require some form of
password authentication. For simplicity, this IM system will not use
authentication, meaning that anyone can log in as a client and
claim any username they choose.</p>

</ul>

<a name="tasks"><h2>Tasks</h2></a>

<ol>

<li><p><b>Team preparation.</b> Meet with your team and complete the <a href="lab-team-building/lab.html">lab
on team building</a>.</p>

<li><p><b>Individual preparation.</b> Complete the
<a href="lab-networking/lab.html">lab on networking</a>
by checking out <tt>friendly</tt> from your personal SVN repository.
You may also complete the <a href="lab-swing/lab.html">optional Swing lab</a>
by checking out <tt>guiwords</tt> from your personal SVN repository (or you may do this
lab with your group). These labs are independent of each other.
</p></li>

<li><p><b>Abstract design.</b> Define a precise notion of
<i>conversation</i> in your IM system. See the <a
href="#hints">hints</a> on how to do this.
Construct an object model that captures the essential concepts of 
instant messaging from a problem perspective, and their relationships to one another.
Explain the important modeling decisions you made. Describe alternatives to particular
decisions and justify your choice.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Client/server protocol.</b> Design a set of commands the clients and server
will use to communicate, allowing clients to perform the actions stipulated by the
specification. Create a specification of the client/server protocol as a grammar or
state machine. Describe possible protocol messages, the state of the server, and the
state of the client (if it stores any).</p></li>

<li><p><b>Usability design.</b> Sketch your user interface and its various screens and dialogs.
Use these sketches to explore alternatives quickly and to plan the structure and flow
of your interface. <i>Sketching on paper</i> is recommended. Turn in the sketches you
decided to go with, along with commentary as needed to explain non-obvious parts.
Briefly point out the merits of your design.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Code design.</b> Design your program with a module dependency diagram that includes all
model, view, and controller classes. Explain important design decisions, and justify your choices
with reference to specific alternatives for particular decisions.
Your design should minimize the risk of concurrency bugs
(like race conditions and deadlocks) and should support easy
unit testing of your modules.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Testing strategy.</b> Devise a strategy for testing your IM system. Describe what automated tests
you will use, and what manual tests you will perform.
Since UI front-end testing is often most easily done by hand,
documentation of your strategy is especially important. As you think about how to test your program,
you are likely to find that you want to revisit your code design (for example, to make a cleaner
API to permit unit testing independently of the GUI).</p></li>

<li><p><b>Implementation.</b> As always, your code should be clear, well-organized, and usefully documented.
See the <a href="#hints">hints</a> for further suggestions.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Testing.</b> Execute your testing strategy, using JUnit and
by performing manual tests of the GUI. In your report, document the results of your manual tests.
</p></li>

<!--
<li><p><b>Analysis.</b> Write a brief analysis of your user interface as outlined
in the <a href="#analysis">next section</a>.</p></li>
-->

<li><p><b>Reflection.</b> Write a brief commentary describing what you learned from this experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>What was easy?</li>
<li>What was hard?</li>
<li>What was unexpected?</li>
<li>What would you do differently in designing the chat system if you were to do
it again?</li></ul></li>

</ol>

<!--
<a name="analysis"><h2>Analysis</h2></a>

<p>Usability is topic worthy of (at least) a semester's study on its own. Designing and analyzing one GUI will
not make anyone a usability expert, but software engineers frequently work on projects where the user
interface is an important component of an overall system, and where members of the development team will
be devoted to designing a usable interface. Your goal for this project is to become familiar with the language
and basic principles of usability through a design critique.</p>

<p>Your critique should be based on the following <b>four principles</b>:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Learnability</b>. How easy is it for <i>new users</i> to learn how to use your interface?
Is it simple, with as few commands and controls as possible?
Is it consistent with other interfaces they have used before?  
Are buttons, menus, and other controls labeled with simple, clear, familiar terms?

<li><b>Efficiency</b>. How efficient is the interface for <i>frequent users</i> who have already learned it?
Do frequent operations require many mouse clicks or keystrokes?
Does the interface offer shortcuts for common operations?</li>

<li><b>Visibility</b>. How visible is the state of the system?
When the user issues a command, does the system give sufficient feedback, e.g. making the effect of that command 
immediately visible?
If there are commands that take a long time to run, does the system give feedback about progress?</li>

<li><b>Errors</b>. What errors are possible, to what extent are errors prevented, and how can users recover from errors?
Is it easy to perform destructive or irreversible actions unintentionally?
Is it easy to undo mistakes?
Does the interface have different modes (states where the same user action invokes different commands), which may lead
to &quot;mode errors&quot; (trying to use the command in the wrong mode).
Are such modes clearly visible?</li>
</ul>

<p>You should structure your critique around at least <b>two <i>user scenarios</i></b>. A
scenario describes a user's <i>task</i>, and the steps they take to complete that task. Note that
users do not have tasks like &quot;click the 'Open' button&quot; &mdash; this is a step toward
completing a task that might be &quot;post today's lecture notes to the course web
site.&quot;</p>

<p>For each scenario you describe, discuss how your user interfaces fares with respect to the
given principles. For example: <blockquote>The fact that the file starts uploading right away after
the user selects it improves <i>efficiency</i> because there is no confirmation step. However, it
introduces a problem where the user may choose the wrong file, and the file is now shared for
everyone to see. The interface allows the user to <i>recover from this error</i> by providing a
&quot;cancel&quot; button until the next file is chosen, even after the upload has
completed.</blockquote> </p>

<p>Write at least one scenario from the perspective of a <i>new</i> user, and one from the
perspective of a <i>frequent</i> user. Include annotated screenshots or cropped images of parts
of your UI to emphasize or clarify where needed. Your critique should be no longer than a few
pages, including screenshots.</p>

<a name="infrastructure"><h2>Infrastructure</h2></a>

<p>Use the <a href="lab-networking/lab.html">networking lab</a> to learn about network I/O in Java,
and the <a href="lab-swing/lab.html">Swing lab</a> for details on GUI programming.</p>

<p>No initial code is provided for this project. However, two <i>runner</i> classes are provided with
<tt>main</tt> methods you should fill in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Running <tt>main.Client.main(String[])</tt> must start an instance of your GUI chat client.</li>
<li>Running <tt>main.Server.main(String[])</tt> must start an instance of your chat server.</li>
</ul>

<p>You should consider using packages other than <tt>main</tt> to organize your code.</p>

<a name="deliverables"><h2>Deliverables and Grading</h2></a>

<p>There are <i>three</i> deadlines for this project.</p>

<p>For <u>the first deadline</u> (<b>5:00 PM, May 5, 2009</b>), your deliverables are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the team contract;</li>
<li>the abstract designs and discussion;</li>
<li>the client/server protocol;</li>
<li>and the usability design.</li>
</ul>

<p>This design deliverable should be submitted by
committing <b>one</b> PDF to the <tt>deliverables</tt> folder of your
project repository. For your user interface sketches, you should
either scan the files and place them in your PDF
(see <a href="#resources">resources</a> for a list of scanners on
campus), <i>or</i> you may use some drawing tool or even implement a
Swing prototype (just GUI with no functionality) to present a few
snapshots of your interface design.</p>

<p>You will meet with your TA on the next day (11:00 AM, Wednesday,
May 6, 2009) during the work period to discuss these topics.</p>

<p>For <u>the second deadline</u> (<b>11:00 AM, May 8, 2009</b>), you will meet with your TA, and your deliverables are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the code designs and discussion;</li>
<li>the testing strategy;</li>
<li>and a demo of <i>some</i> working portion of the project that demonstrates significant effort towards
understanding a critical or high-risk area of the design.</li>
</ul>

<p>The code designs and testing strategy must be submitted by 11am on
May 8 as <b>one</b> PDF in the <tt>deliverables</tt> folder of your
repository.  Bring a printout with you to the meeting with your TA.
The demo will take place at the meeting.</p>

<p>Your demo might show, for example, a basic server that sends and
receives messages but without a GUI client (see the
the <a href="#hints">hints</a> about <tt>telnet</tt>). Or you might
have a working basic GUI with no server backend but a simple API for
connecting to one. Talk to your TA beforehand if you are unsure about
what is sufficient.</p>

<p>The meeting will also include discussion of the design deliverables from the first two deadlines.</p>

<p>For <u>the third and final</u> deadline (<b>midnight, May 12, 2009</b>), your deliverables are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the implementation;</li>
<li>the tests;</li>
<li>the testing report;</li>
<li>and your reflections on the project.</li>
</ul>

<p>The report and reflections should be committed as <b>one</b> PDF in
the <tt>deliverables</tt> folder.</p>

<p>The grading breakdown is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>30% for the abstract design, protocol, and usability design</li>
<li>25% for the code design, initial demo, and testing strategy</li>
<li>35% for implementation and testing</li>
<li>10% for reflection</li>
</ul>

<a name="awards"><h2>Awards</h2></a>

<p>The course staff will judge and award prizes to teams whose instant messaging systems
embody exemplary design and implementation.</p>

<p>You may <b>submit your project for prize consideration on Monday
May 11 during lecture time, 11am-12:30pm, in 32-G825</b>.  Your team
will give a 5-minute presentation to the course staff in which you
demonstrate your system and describe its design. You must commit your
work (up to that point) to Subversion by 11 am on May 11. You
are <b>not</b> required to give this presentation (but then you won't
win anything, either). And everyone can continue to work on the
project until the final deadline, but only the work demonstrated in
this presentation will be considered for prizes.</p>

<p>Serious award contenders should consider going above and beyond the
required specification to implement their own extensions.</p>

<p>You might add standard instant messaging features like away
messages, auto-replies, offline messaging, password-protected
accounts, user icons, graphical emotions... or you might integrate
voice chat, a shared whiteboard, encrypted conversations with perfect
forward secrecy, or something as yet unheard of!</p>

<a name="hints"><h2>Hints</h2></a>

<b>Defining a conversation.</b> Part of your job is to determine what
a conversation means. For example, does a conversation have a name,
and can other users join the conversation by specifying the name? Is
it like a chat room, that people can enter and exit? In that case, can
a conversation be empty (a chat room can), waiting for users?

<p>Or is a conversation more like a phone call, where a person "dials"
another person? In that case, can the receiving party deny the
conversation?

<p> However you define a conversation, remember to <i>keep it simple
for your first iteration.</i> You can always extend your program with
interesting ideas if you have time left.

<p><b>Designing a protocol.</b> You must also devise a client/server protocol
for this project. You should strongly consider using a text-based protocol, which
may be easier for testing and debugging.

<p>Services that use plain text protocols &mdash; e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP">HTTP</a>
or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMTP">SMTP</a> &mdash; can talk
to a human just as well as another machine by using a client program that sends
and receives characters. Such a client program
already exists on almost all operating systems, called <tt>telnet</tt>.  
You can run <tt>telnet</tt> by opening a command prompt
and typing <tt>telnet <i>hostname</i> <i>port</i></tt>.  The 
<a href="lab-networking/lab.html">lab</a> gives you some experience with
using telnet.

<p>
<b>Handling multiple clients.</b>  Since instant messaging is useless without
at least two people, your server must be able to handle multiple clients
connected at the same time.  The Friendly server you'll develop in the 
<a href="lab-networking/lab.html">lab</a> gives you some starting code, but note that 
Friendly doesn't need its clients to interact or share any state.  Your server 
will certainly need to do that.  One reasonable design approach follows the
Friendly model (using one thread for reading input from each client) but adds
a central state machine representing the state of the server (using one more
thread, to which each of the client threads pass messages through a shared
queue).

<p>Read the socket documentation referenced in the lab to understand how network
sockets operate in Java. Consider how, for example,
the server will write to clients while at the same time awaiting messages from them.</p>

<p><b>Design for safe concurrency.</b> In general, making an argument
that an implementation is free of concurrency bugs (like race
conditions and deadlocks) is very difficult and error-prone.  The best
strategy therefore is to design your program to allow a very simple
argument, by limiting your use of concurrency and especially avoiding
shared state wherever possible.  For example, one approach is to use
concurrency only for reading sockets, and to make the rest of the
design single-threaded.

<p>And note that, even though user interfaces are concurrent by
nature,<b>Swing is not thread safe</b>. Understand what code will run
in the main thread, threads you explicitly spin, or the Swing event
dispatching thread. Recommended reading:
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/tsc/articles/threads/threads1.html">Threads
and Swing</a>.</p>

<p><b>Design for testability.</b> To make it possible to write unit
tests without having to open socket connections and parse streams of
responses, you should design your state machine(s) in such a way that
they can be driven directly by a unit test -- either by calling
methods, or by putting messages into a queue read by the state
machine's thread.

<p>Testing GUIs is particularly challenging.  Follow good design
practice and separate as much functionality as possible into modules
you can test using automated mechanisms. You should maximize the
amount of your system you can test with complete independence from any
GUI.</p>

<p>Another useful testing technique is the idea of a <i>stub</i>
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_stub">method stubs</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object">mock
objects</a>). To test one component of your system in isolation, you
can create trivial implementations of the other components with which
it is coupled. This might allow you to test your server without
opening network connections, or to test your client backend with
automated rather than GUI tests.</p>

<p><b>Implementation.</b> Develop in iterations.  Focus on important
modules first, and defer making cosmetic improvements to your user
interface until after all the code is well-organized and thoroughly
tested.  Make use of assertions.</p>
