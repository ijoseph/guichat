Team Contract:
Goals:
Team Goals: To receive an acceptable grade, and to work especially hard on our GUI to make it useful and intuitive, since all of use are interested in learning more about GUI design.
Personal Goals: Each of us will work on our own to define our individual goals.
Obstacles: We expect to encounter time constraints, and the need to learn new ideas and concepts in Java.
Our team agrees that we'd like to work hard and try to get an A, and not decide that a B will be acceptable.  It is acceptable, but not ideal for one or two team members to do more work than others in order for the team to get an A.

Meeting Norms:
We have no specific preference for meeting locations.  We'll try to divide meetings so that some occur near each team member.
We'll try to meet briefly every day, but realistically we expect it will be closer to every other day.
We expect most meetings to be between a half hour and an hour.
Eating will be acceptable.
We plan to use Subversion to track the agenda, minutes, and action lists from each meeting.

Work Norms:
We expect this project will take about 20 hours per week per individual to complete.
We will divide different tasks in the project equally among different group members.
We'll decide on different deadlines for tasks as they fit with other tasks at our team meetings.
Individuals that are more interested in different tasks will be assigned to them as can possibly be done.
We'll record who is responsible for what in our meeting notes.
If people don't follow through we'll adjust our plan accordingly to get the work done.
At meetings, team members will describe their code, their approach, and we'll discuss the quality and effectiveness.
If we have disagreements on the quality of work on the project, we'll ask questions to TAs and try to resolve it.
If team members aren't doing their share, we'll discuss that with them individually and try to fix the problem.
We'll work at different times to fit with all of our team members individual habits.

Decision Making:
For major decisions, we should have a reasonable consensus from all team members.  That means a majority of the group should support the design, and the rest of the group should also be able to work with that decision.
If one team member fixates on a particular idea, we'll present alternatives and discuss it.
